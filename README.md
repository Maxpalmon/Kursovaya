About

This is an educational project with a purpose to dive deeper into asynchronous and multithreaded Java code.

The project is inspired by the theme of a trip companies.

The main idea of this project was to create a Server which is able to process requests from multiple Clients at the same time. The server also has a database to store user data. On the other hand the Clients should be able to connect to the Server, authenticate, receive some data from server database and manipulate some of this data.
